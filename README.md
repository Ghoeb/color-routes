# Color Routes
Repository for experimenting with backtracking and enhancements to a graph edge assignment problem

## The problem

Given an edgeless graph where nodes have a specific desired degree, and some nodes have a color assigned while others don't, set the edges to satisfy the following:

_If (u,v) is an edge on the graph, then the nodes u and v have the same color assigned_

_All nodes on the graph have a color assigned_

_All nodes have their desired degree_

## Dependencies
